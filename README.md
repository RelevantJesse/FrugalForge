# FrugalForge (Anniversary) — In‑Game Profession Leveling Planner

FrugalForge is a single‑addon solution for Classic/Anniversary that scans Auction House prices, tracks owned
materials, and generates a full profession leveling plan entirely in‑game. No web app, no import/export.

---

## ✅ Key Features

- All‑in‑game planning  
  Build targets, scan prices, capture owned mats, and generate a plan without leaving WoW.
- Auction House scanner  
  Uses the legacy AH browse API (QueryAuctionItems) with exact‑name searches for reliable pricing.
- Owned materials support  
  Pulls inventory from BagBrother (Bagnon) and subtracts what you already own.
- Crafting intermediates  
  Automatically expands craftable reagents (e.g., settings, bolts, wire) so you don’t buy things you can make.
- Clear shopping list  
  Shows item names, quantities needed, owned counts, and total costs.
- Minimap button  
  Left‑click opens FrugalForge, Ctrl‑click starts an AH scan.
- Planning options  
  Ignore owned mats for selection, limit to current character only, and tune owned value factor.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Build Targets  
   Open `/frugal`, pick your profession, set skill range, click **Build Targets**.
2. Scan Auction House  
   Go to the AH and run `/frugalscan start` (or click **Scan AH**).
3. Capture Owned Mats  
   Run `/frugalscan owned` to record your inventory (requires BagBrother).
4. Generate Plan  
   Click **Generate Plan** to get:
   - Step‑by‑step recipe plan
   - Intermediate crafts (if any)
   - Shopping list with prices

## 📦 Requirements

- WoW Classic Anniversary
- BagBrother (Bagnon) for owned material tracking
